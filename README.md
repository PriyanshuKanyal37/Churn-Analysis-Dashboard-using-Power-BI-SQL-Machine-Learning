# Churn-Analysis-Dashboard-using-Power-BI-SQL-Machine-Learning

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end churn analysis using Power BI for visualization, SQL Server for data processing, and Python for machine learning-based churn prediction.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Telecom company wants to identify and reduce customer churn using data-driven insights.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- SQL Server
- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook)
- DAX

## 📊 Key Features
- Interactive Power BI dashboard with churn KPIs
- SQL ETL pipeline for data cleaning and processing
- Machine Learning (Random Forest) for churn prediction
- ML output integrated into Power BI

## 🤖 Machine Learning Integration

The ML part of this project involves:

- Using a cleaned dataset exported from SQL/Power BI
- Preprocessing the data in a **Jupyter Notebook** using **Pandas** and **Label Encoding**
- Building a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict churn (Churned = 1, Stayed = 0)
- Evaluating the model using **confusion matrix** and **classification report**
- Exporting predictions as a `.csv` and importing into Power BI
- Creating a **Churn Prediction Page** in Power BI to visualize predicted churners

This enables stakeholders to not only analyze past data, but **anticipate future churn**.

## 🛠️ What This Project Does

This end-to-end churn analysis solution includes:

- **SQL Server**: ETL pipeline, data cleaning, null handling, and transformation
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards with KPIs (churn rate, new joiners, revenue impact)
- **Power Query**: Applied transformations to enhance grouping and segmentation (e.g., Monthly Charge Buckets, Age & Tenure Groups)
- **Python & Machine Learning**: Random Forest classifier to predict customers likely to churn
- **Integrated ML output into Power BI** for churn profiling and decision-making
